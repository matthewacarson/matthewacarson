### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I graduated in June 2024 from the University of California, Los Angeles, *summa cum laude*, with a double major in Sociology and Political Science. During my senior year, I completed two senior thesesâ€”one in sociology and the other in political scienceâ€”both of which won the best thesis prize in their respective departments.

The sociology thesis was a historical-comparative project that analyzed different methods of union organizing. Specifically, I focused on how construction unions organize and establish relations with employers, and how this corresponds with more employer-friendly political stances compared to other unions. Additionally, I explored how these organizing methods place construction unions in a weaker position, hindering their ability to challenge management and defend workersâ€™ interests.

The political science thesis examined the relationship between economic inequality, gentrification, and police killings, using census tract household income data and the Urban Displacement Projectâ€™s gentrification typologies. I also analyzed the interactions between the race of the victim, the racial composition of the census tract, and the median household income. My hope is that this project contributes to a better understanding of the relationship between race, economic inequality, gentrification, and police killings.
